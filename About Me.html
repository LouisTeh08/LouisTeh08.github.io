    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Louis, and this website is part of my school project focused on raising awareness about preventing animal extinction. As a student passionate about wildlife and the environment, I wanted to create a space where people can learn about the importance of protecting endangered species and the actions we can take to help them survive.
        Through this project, I’ve learned how serious the issue of animal extinction is, with many species facing threats like habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change. But there’s hope! By working together, we can make a difference. On this site, you’ll find information about endangered animals and how we can all do to protect them.
        I hope this website inspires you to take action, whether it's by spreading awareness, supporting conservation organizations, or making more eco-friendly choices in your daily life. Together, we can help prevent animal extinction and create a better future for wildlife.
        Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find the information here helpful and inspiring!</p>
